He described his dog as being very healthy and fit prior to the incident. While hunting, the dog was exposed to the water between the hours of 7:00am-2:00pm. The hunter said he did not observe a bloom, but he described the water as stagnant. Late Sunday night/ early Monday morning, the hunter noticed that his dog was in distress. He said the dog appeared to have lost control of its body movements and was shaking. The dog was taken to a veterinarian, and then to an animal hospital where the vet observed convulsions, irregular heartbeat, fluid on the lungs, and both liver and brain damage. The animal was subsequently euthanized on Monday morning. Neither veterinarian could determine the cause of the dogs condition, however, the described symptoms are consistent with known cyanotoxin exposure, and cyanotoxins have been observed in Salton Sea wetlands in the past.
